# Hupa-versions

To evaluate open source tool [Hupa](http://james.apache.org/hupa/index.html), we have considered 13 pairs of versions. In total, we have selected 6 revisions of the Hupa repository including the most recent one to do our evaluation. In this directory, you will find 8 additional versions of Hupa that have been created by seeding errors in the Hupa code or by re-using code-snippets of some ancient Hupa revisions:
- EclipseHupaR_02Search
- EclipseHupaR_03
- EclipseHupaR_04
- EclipseHupaR_05
- EclipseHupaR1684702_J1
- EclipseHupaR1684702_J2
- EclipseHupaR1684702_J3
- EclipseHupaR1684702_J4
These Hupa versions are available as Eclipse-plugin.

If you do not want to [build Hupa from source](http://james.apache.org/hupa/building.html), you can use a precompiled version which we have used in our evaluation:
- EclipseHupaR1580208
- EclipseHupaR1684470
- EclipseHupaR1684702
They are available for download in this directory. Besides, you will find a instrumented version of Hupa in instrumented/EclipseHupaR1684470.
