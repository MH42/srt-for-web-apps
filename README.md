# srt-for-web-apps

In this repository, we offer our Eclipse-Plug-in GWTTestCaseSelection for download. GWTTestCaseSelection compares the current version of your Google Web Toolkit (GWT)-based web application with a previous version in order to localize as much as pssible code modifications and to select web tests affected by these code changes.

In the evaluation of GWTTestCaseSelection, we have used the open source mail client [Hupa](http://james.apache.org/hupa/index.html). Apart from the official revisions which are available in their own repository, we have asked a college to create additional version by seeding errors. We offer these versions in this repository for download. 

Unfortunately, the authors of Hupa do not provide web tests to test their tool. For this reason, we have asked another college to create some web tests using [Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org/). His web tests and the ones created by ourself are also available for download.
